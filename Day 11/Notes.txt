They enhance SEO, improve accessibility and make your code easier to read and maintain.
So, simply speaking, it is used to make our content organised and well-suited for a reader or user to look into it.
 
Benefits :

Semantic tags tell browser or web crawlers about what your website is and where each thing placed in the website, is telling us

it is displayed accordingly.
