We can change the theme of the whole website using just one thing - VARIABLES !

Note :
ul li: This selector targets all li elements that are descendants of any ul element, regardless of how deeply nested they are 
in the HTML structure. It will apply the specified styles to all li elements that are descendants of any ul element, even if 
they are nested within other elements.

ul > li: This selector targets only the li elements that are direct children of a ul element. It uses the child combinator > to 
select only the immediate children of the ul, ignoring any li elements that are nested further down in the hierarchy. It will 
apply the specified styles only to li elements that are immediate children of a ul element.
