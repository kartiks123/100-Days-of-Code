Google does the following 3 things in its backend, for putting up the website on top of other websites so that other users see 
this first. This is based on : 
    1) how *fast* the website opens up 
    2) whether right *information is present* or not
    3) whether *user experience* is good or not

So if your content is good, along with Core Web Vitals, your content will be given preference first.



1) CLS stands for Cumulative Layout Shift. It should be as less as possible. How much page is shifted, while it is being loaded.
CLS is the first thing that comes first in Core Web Vitals.

2) LCP stands for Largest Contexual Paint. It means if a user is accessing an element inside a website, the most biggest picture
loads in how many seconds is what LCP is. Best time for this is considered as 2.5 seconds.

3) FID stands for First Input Delay. How much time it takes to process an action, like button, link, on a website. Recommended
is under 100 ms.
