Google does the following 3 things in its backend, for putting up the website on top of other websites so that other users see 
this first. This is based on : 
    1) how *fast* the website opens up 
    2) whether right *information is present* or not
    3) whether *user experience* is good or not

So if your content is good, along with Core Web Vitals, your content will be given preference first.



1) CLS stands for Cumulative Layout Shift. It should be as less as possible. How much page is shifted, while it is being loaded.
CLS is the first thing that comes first in Core Web Vitals.

2) LCP stands for Largest Contexual Paint. It means if a user is accessing an element inside a website, the most biggest picture
loads in how many seconds is what LCP is. Best time for this is considered as 2.5 seconds.

3) FID stands for First Input Delay. How much time it takes to process an action, like button, link, on a website. Recommended
is under 100 ms.

Lighthouse Report in Inspect page of a website, tells us about how a website is going to perform.
It will show us all the useful information which we can use to improve our website.
We can check it for both mobile as well as laptop devices.


Meta tags are used to describe more about what is already been written.

If we are using Meta Description (meta:dsc) tags, we can let the browser decide what it wants to show alongside our website,
while a user searches for it. Do this for eg, search "facebook" on google. It will show - "Create an account or log into Facebook. 
Connect with friends, family and other people you know. Share photos and videos, send messages and get updates." This is the 
description about Facebook website, and this part is decided by the browser whether it is what to show here, or to even show 
the desciption or not.
