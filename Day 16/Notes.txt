Today was a solution showing day where we were supposed to get reviews for our challenge which we did for Day 12.

Correction/Modifications :

1) I could have used the div class in a single way, rather than creating it for each element.
Eg-
<div>
    <video src="video1.mp4"></video>
    <video src="video2.mp4"></video>
    <video src="video3.mp4"></video>
    <video src="video4.mp4"></video>
    <video src="video5.mp4"></video>
</div>

Similarly for audio files also.

That's it.
