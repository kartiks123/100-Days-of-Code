We can do many things with FONTS in HTML.

Font-Family :
This is used to change the font stlying of the text that you are writing.

You can give more than 1 font-styling. This is done in cases when the first font style does not run properly, or is not 
fully compatible at the user's end. Just write them with all of them, separated by comma.

We also have to include 1 generic font style so that it runs on all the system. One such example of that font is "Times New
Roman".

Font-Style:
It is set to italic, oblique.

Font-Weight:
It is set to make our texts bold.

Text-Decoration:
To make our text, underline, overline, etc.

You can put take your fonts from Google Fonts, in 2 ways :
1) One you can select it as link.
Through that, you just have to copy and paste the link given under it, to the HTML head tag.
One done, copy and paste the css file also.
2) The second way is to use import the style tag code and then paste the css code in the stylesheet.

In this way you can include many font import or links at the same time.

Font-Size :
By using font-size, you can set up the size of your font that you are adding in your HTML page.

Line Height :
Line Height is something that adds space between the content of 2 lines, written top and bottom of each other.
Eg- Check out the article tag for example.
