In today's time, whenever we are creating any content or website for any client, we want to make it responsive so that it is 
setting to the customer's needs.

We use Media Queries for such purposes.
This will aloow our website to look better for any device, for laptop, desktop pc, mobiles, etc.

We use the tag "@media" :
@media not|only mediatype and (expressions) {
    CSS-Code;
}

We use this format to specify that the media will open on screens only having mediatype, or not having mediatype.

In 'screen' mode, we can view the content in any kind of device that has a screen. Be it a mobile phone, laptop.

'Speech Devices' are used for people who cannot see.

Thus we can view it by inspecting on browser on how the changes are being shown to us in, by adjusting the view in the
responsiveness tab.
Now suppose, we want to allow our boxes to wrap themselves up when we are viewing on mobile.
