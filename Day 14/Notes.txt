CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language that is used to describe the visual presentation of a 
web page written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). 
HTML creates the structure of the page, while CSS adds styling to that structure.

HTML was never intended to create styles to a website. It was only made to create the structure of the website.

<style> tag is used to create styles to a website in HTML.

There are two elements in HTML :
1) Declaration : "color:red;" is our declaration of our div tag in HTML (as shown in eg.).
2) Selectors : "div { }" is our selector here. It represents what section we want in our HTML to change the style of.

There is also a key-value pair.
Eg - color: red;
     Here, color is the key and red is its value.
     They both work in sync to represent the end-result.

Using "," (comma) to separate two different elements while styling them, will do the changes to both the elements.
