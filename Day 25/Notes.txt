Whenever we are using Navigation Bar, there is 70-80% chance that we will want to style our lists.

By default, we have a display property, which is set to "list-item".
-> 'display: list-item'
Through this, we will have a default marker ( a bullet point ) and the written context in front of it.

list-style is used to change the way in which the marker appears.

By-default, the markers are not affected by the background colors, so if we want them to be included inside, what shall we do.
We should use list-style-position.

Here we can also replace the marker style from the default bullet pointer to an image, using 'list-style-image'.
