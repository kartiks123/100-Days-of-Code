There are 3 ways to link CSS with HTML :
1) Inline CSS : This is used in an HTML page using style attributes.
2) Internal CSS : It means to add a style tag and place the HTML page's style within it.
3) External CSS : It means to create a .css file and place all your styles inside that .css file.

Inline CSS is a way to present (style) your elements in a HTML file, in one line at a time. We use "style" attribute for this
purpose. And, this style attribute should be used in the place of the HTML element which we want to style.

Internal CSS is a way to present (style) your elements in a HTML file, by creating a selector for that element.

The main difference between these two is that we have to individually go for each tag and change its style attribute individually
if we are doing Inline CSS.
So in order to not fall under this, we use Internal CSS, in the same HTML page.

But there might be cases due to which, using Internal CSS will make our HTML page bigger.
So we use External CSS for the purpose, to create a separate stylesheet and link it to that HTML page.

For smaller scale, you can use Inline as well as Internal CSS, but it is recommended to always go for External CSS.
