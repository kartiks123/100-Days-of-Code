There are 3 ways to link CSS with HTML :
1) Inline CSS : This is used in an HTML page using style attributes.
2) Internal CSS : It means to add a style tag and place the HTML page's style within it.
3) External CSS : It means to create a .css file and place all your styles inside that .css file.

Inline CSS is a way to present (style) your elements in a HTML file, in one line at a time. We use "style" attribute for this
purpose. And, this style attribute should be used in the place of the HTML element which we want to style.
