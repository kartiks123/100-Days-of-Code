Earlier, developers used to set the division and alignment of each CSS element through intensive coding, by adjusting the 
floats and positioning of them. But it was difficult earlier.
So the need of FlexBox aroused from that.

We have various use of FlexBox. The main use of it is of aligning the content of the elements in the center, both in terms of vertical alignment and items
alignment.
Also it's not necessary that you have to align your elements in a center manner. You can also put it in a flex-end (to mark it in the end position), flex-start
(to mark it in the starting position), etc. There are many element-styling in flex that you might need to work on, but due to this 70% of the work is done.

Now, first mark each and every item with numbers written in ascending order. If we are writing the numbers with the command - 'flex-direction: column', it will 
mark the data columnwise.
But if, we mark the data in the command - 'flex-direction: column-reverse', it will mark it the same, just in reverse order.
