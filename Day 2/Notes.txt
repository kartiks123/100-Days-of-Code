Today we are going to create our own website in HTML and also link it to CSS and JS !
Let's start.

The link between the HTML and CSS file is needed to be done so as to tell them both that they agree mutually to create a website together !

JS file is also needed to be linked in our HTML file, using Script tag and a src attribute. All this falls under the Emmet Abbreviation.
Also, remember that we type both of this, just above the ending segment of the <body> tag.

Without loading the pages, whatever actions are responded with a response/answer from a server, back to the client, is what JS is all about.
