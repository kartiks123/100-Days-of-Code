Now while running this code that was written without any property used for float, the content is very bad for reading purpose.

Now to write it in a more effective way, we can write it with the property of "display: flow-root"
So now, all the borders and text will float rightwards, towards the image aligned on the left; according to 'float:left'.

It will be visible in a way that is both suiting to what newspapers show to us.


But what if, I don't want in my 2nd div (lorem 355) to show content on its left ?
Then in this case, I will use 'clear'.


We can use clear to clear the content on left, right or both sides (using 'clear:both'), of the selected CSS element.



We should never use 'float' and 'clear', as it is not in use so much right now. In today's world, flexbox should be used, about
which we will learn later :) !
