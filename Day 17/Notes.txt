CSS Selectors :
They allow us to choose specific elements and apply styles to them.
We select elements by name or class.

If we want only a particular section of div element to be selected by us and get styled, then we can use classes or id for this
purpose.

class="division1"
id="division1"

Here is the reference link for both, Classes and ID :
https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_id_class

You can use class as many times as possible but id can be used only 1 time.
That means, classes can be referred multiple times but id's can only be referred one time.

There are also child selectors.
This means that you can select an element inside another element, by selecting it as - "one element" > "second element"

Then there are also Descendant selector.
It is a way to select elements that are located somewhere underneath other elements.
Eg - is shown in HTML page

Child selector should be a direct child element under the parent element. Like we did in the example shown.
Where paragraph element was under the div element.
But...
Descendant selector is used in the case when there is an element present anywhere within the parent element.
So, we can use that directly.

There are many selectors in HTML. But the main ones are these only.

Then there are Pseudo Selectors like - 
a:hover
a:active
a:link
a:visited

This can only work if you have created anchor tags first.

Then there are another type of Pseudo Selector : as shown in Eg.
Through it, let's understand it first.

We have created a "p:first-child". This tells us that we are going to apply the style or make the changes only to the first 
appearance of the child class, inside a particular parent class. And the rest of its elements (child elements) are not going 
to be affected by the change.
