We know that there are certain elements which are block level elements. For eg- div.
But what if I told you, that you can convert it into an inline element.

We can do so, by changing the styling of "display:inline".


In this property though, if we try to set our padding, margin and width, the browser won't respond to our needs/changes.
Why does this happens ?
This happens because these element changers does not respect the styling of an inline element (now that you have changed the 
display to inline through 'display:inline', it will respond as an inline element, not as a block element.)

Hence, in order to get a remedy, we use 'display:inline-block".
