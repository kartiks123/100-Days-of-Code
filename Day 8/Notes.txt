Inline Elements: 
Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. 

Block Elements: 
Block level elements are those that start on a new line and take up the entire width of their container by 
default. 
They essentially claim all the horizontal space fo rthemselves, pushing any content that comes after them to a new line 

Both of these fall under display property and these two can be set by CSS also. 

Here if you add background color in the CSS folder, you can see that the paragraph's background is fully coloured in width 
in aqua colour, and that of anchor tag is only that much filled in background with green colour, till it is required. 
Hence, this shows that paragraph is a block element and anchor tag is an inline element. 

Coming with how many elements are block or inline, here is a reference : 
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp 

It is not necessary that an inline element will remain an inline element, and a block element will remain a block element. Both 
of these can be set using CSS properties.
