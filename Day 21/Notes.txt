Specificity in CSS

In order to resolve any cascading problems in CSS, we use The Cascade Algorithm.

The cascade algorithm has 4 distinct stages:
1) Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear
2) Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
3) Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, 
or your authored CSS
4) Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type
