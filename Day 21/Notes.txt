Specificity in CSS

In order to resolve any cascading problems in CSS, we use The Cascade Algorithm.

The cascade algorithm has 4 distinct stages:
1) Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear
2) Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
3) Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, 
or your authored CSS
4) Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type

Proofs of each case :
1)
In the first case, we have elements arranged as :
<style>
        
    h1 {
        background-color: yellow;
    }

   .hey {
        background-color: aqua;
    }
        
    .hi {
        background-color: red;
    }

    .hello {
        background-color: blue;
    }

</style>

and the classes as :
<div>
    <h1 class="hey hi hello">CSS Specificity</h1>
</div>

First, we see that all of them are classes. So they share the same responsibility.
Now, according to this, the class selector written at the last (latest value) is considered and prioritised, and so the bg-color
changes according to that.
The bg-color is blue now.

but when we change the css style to  :
    h1 {
            background-color: yellow;
    }

    .hey {
        background-color: aqua;
    }
        
    .hello {
        background-color: blue;
    }
        
    .hi {
        background-color: red;
    }

The color changes to red.
 
The Position where the element is added, also affects the styling of the page.
Eg- shown above for last element of "red".

2)
Specificity is important in places where we want to consider and favour the element which has the most thing specified, in the 
best way.
So, the order of specificity is:
Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector

3)
Order is something that is done from the browser end automatically, if no syling is provided. 
A browser has its own set of order and preference when it comes to do the task at its own side.
It applies "user agent stylesheet" on it.
If we write our own stylesheet, then it simply, overwrites the user agent stylesheet.

4)
The !important flag in CSS is used to give a particular style rule the highest level of importance, overriding any other 
competing styles, even Inline Styling. When you add !important to a CSS rule, it will take precedence over other rules affecting the same element, 
regardless of their specificity.
Eg- shown in code.
