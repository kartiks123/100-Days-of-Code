We have so many more options that we are going to talk about in this section now...
REMEMBER, I AM COMMENTING OUT THE PREVIOUS FUNCTIONS AS I AM PROCEEDING FORWARD, IN THE style.css FOLDER.

1) .'class-name-here':first-child {} - will affect the first child class element only, under a parent element.

2) .'class-name-here':first-line {} - will change the way that the first line of the paragraph is.
Note: You can even check through responsiveness, that only your first line is changing, irrespective of the width set to it.

3) .'class-name-here' * {} - will allow you to change the styling property of all the elements inside the class.

4) There are various other selectors like, attribute selectors, using which we can set a class to a certain css element.
Through this we can directly change the style of that element, using that same class-name. 
This class name is random and is referred to as "['your-attribute-name]" in your CSS file.

5) Also, you can set multiple selectors in the same section. (proven above)

6) We can even set the styles to a certain even or odd element, using - " 'your-class-name':nth-child(even/odd) {} "

7) We can use 'before' or 'after' to insert elements through CSS, dynamically.

8) Sometimes we need to add our content, before or after the already "established" conten (content that has been already 
   written).
   Remember, that they are pseudo-selectors, not elements.
   Remember, 

9) "::selection" -
    We can change the color of the elements inside our website, after we have selected them (like we did after hovering them).

10) We can even change a certain element inside a particular element.
For eg- we can change the placeholder style settings, inside a form element.
