When we run the code with CSS styling done to -
.box {
    width: 10vw;
    height: 40vh;
    border: 2px solid black;
}

, it will show our content as overflowed, i.e., out of the box.

We can resolve it in two ways :
1) either using scroll button through - 'overflow: scroll;'.

overflow: auto is used for those cases, when we want a scroll bar to show, only when the content has overflown in the box.

2) or using horizontal spacing only through - 'white-space: nowrap;'.
