When we run the code with CSS styling done to -
.box {
    width: 10vw;
    height: 40vh;
    border: 2px solid black;
}

, it will show our content as overflowed, i.e., out of the box.

We can resolve it in two ways :
1) either using scroll button through - 'overflow: scroll;'.

overflow: auto is used for those cases, when we want a scroll bar to show, only when the content has overflown in the box.

2) or using horizontal spacing only through - 'white-space: nowrap;'.
Along with this, the text won't be in another line. It will remain in a single line and horizontal bar will appear to view the
rest of the content.

test-overflow: ellipsis; is used if you want to show the rest of the content as '...', after it has reached the edge.

overflow: clip will not allow you to scroll + it will hide the content after it has reached the edge.

We can set the overflow for both y and x axis too. 
Use overflow-y and overflow-x for this purpose.

'overflow:auto' is best considered as it allows us to use scroll bar, only if it is needed !
