CSS Box Model:
Where the margin, border and padding are set inside the element of the whole HTML website.
This shows like a box so that's why it has been named to a box model of the Web D.

In this, our every element that we use in our Web D designing is made, under a single box design.
This box design consists of several things:

1) Content : 

2) Padding : 

3) Margin : 

4) Border : 

There is a default padding and margin set by the browser, which gives some space and look to the content that we add in our
front-end.

We can also set up different classes under the same category and still call both of those, using the common parent class-name.
Eg- 
<div class="box box1">I am a box</div>
<div class="box box2">I am also a box</div>

Then you can call both of these styles by calling the universal selector, under style attribute.
Also remember, that we can give multiple classes to the same HTML element, but we can't give multiple id's to the same HTML
element.
