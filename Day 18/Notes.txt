CSS Box Model:
Where the margin, border and padding are set inside the element of the whole HTML website.
This shows like a box so that's why it has been named to a box model of the Web D.

In this, our every element that we use in our Web D designing is made, under a single box design.
This box design consists of several things:

1) Content : 

2) Padding : 

3) Margin : 

4) Border : 

There is a default padding and margin set by the browser, which gives some space and look to the content that we add in our
front-end.

We can also set up different classes under the same category and still call both of those, using the common parent class-name.
Eg- 
<div class="box box1">I am a box</div>
<div class="box box2">I am also a box</div>

Then you can call both of these styles by calling the universal selector, under style attribute.
Also remember, that we can give multiple classes to the same HTML element, but we can't give multiple id's to the same HTML
element.

Hence, we can set the overall bg-color of both the boxes to 1 color, and then change the font color of both the individual 
elements separately by calling out their own made classes.

Now, coming back to BOX MODEL :
(here is the reference link : https://www.codewithharry.com/tutorial/css-box-model/)

The total width and height of the element is calculated with the formula:
Total Width = Width + Left Padding + Right Padding + Left Border + Right Border + Left Margin + Right Margin
Total Height = Height + Top Padding + Bottom Padding + Top Border + Bottom Border + Top Margin + Bottom Margin

NOTE: (MAGIC)
When viewing your website, go to inspect and then after selecting your element, click on "computed" button next to style.
You can view your margin, padding and border pixels in real-time.

The background color that we apply to the element that we are styling, gets coloured within the "padding" region, not the 
"margin" region.
Eg- as shown in code.

Sometimes, due to DPI factor, our border pixels might show different than what they usually tends to show.

By default, the width and height of an element is calculated like this:
width + padding + border = actual width of an element
height + padding + border = actual height of an element

To get the actual height and width of the CSS element, we use Box-Sizing 
(here is the reference link : https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_box-sizing.asp)

The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

This tells us that margin is not included whenever we give height and width to an element.
If we don't include this, we are showing the width and height of the content part only. Not content+border+padding.
Box size gives us that.
