Box-Shadow:
It is a popular CSS property that enables designers to add shadow effects around an element's frame. It can be used to 
give any element, be it a div, image, or button, a 3D feel or to emphasize on hover.

"box-shadow: h-offset v-offset blur spread color inset;"

h-offset and v-offset: Determines the shadow's horizontal and vertical position.
blur: The larger the value, the blurrier the shadow.
spread: Expands or shrinks the shadow size.
color: Defines the shadow color.
inset: Makes the shadow inner.

Here is an example:
.div-element { box-shadow: 5px 5px 15px 5px #888888; }

Best usage of these is through INSPECT button on browser. There you can set the values directly and then copy and paste it back 
to your source code.


Outlines:
An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the borders, to make the element "stand out". It's commonly used for 
accessibility purposes, like highlighting focused elements.

The Syntax for Outlines is as follows:
"outline: width style color;"
width: Sets the outline width.
style: Determines the style of the outline such as solid, dotted, or dashed.
color: Sets the outline color.

But hey, this is same as border.

Difference between outline and border: 
Position: Outlines don't take up space; they're drawn around the element, outside of any border.
Offset: Using the outline-offset property, you can set the space between an outline and the edge or border of an element.
Width: Borders can have varying widths on different sides, outlines have a uniform width.
Rounded Corners: Borders can have rounded corners using border-radius, while outlines generally cannot.

Outline offset is used to increase the range (doori) of the outline element from the content.
