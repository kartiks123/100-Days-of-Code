There are many units by using which you can, set the dimensions of the CSS element that you are adding to your website.

1) Pixels (px):
Pixels is 1/96th of an inch (0.26 mm).
So if you give the full pixel length of your native resolution, it will cover the full screen resolution.
Eg- my device's resolution is 1366x768.
Hence, I will set the width of my screen to that and it will show correctly when I will view the content of that element.

If we give more than what our resolution is, then scroll bar will appear, indicating that you have to navigate your screen 
to view more of the content ahead. And that, at times, is not required because it makes the website look bad.

So, there might be times when we have to use a more, better, responsive unit.

2) Viewport Width (vw):
The width of the element will be equal to the viewport of the device, horizontally.
So we just give it, width: 100vw;

Here is the reference link to understand the styling difference between both the paragraphs, under div element :

Remember :
You cannot set the width for inline elements. You can only do that for block level elements.

3) margin : auto
This element is used to set the CSS element within the website, in an equal portion from all sides.
If for eg, we are providing like "margin: 23 px auto;", it will set the margin from top and bottom and will set it to middle
because of 'auto'.

4) Viewport Height (vh):
The height of the element will be equal to the viewport of the device, vertically.
So we just give it, 'height: 80vw;'.

5) Emphasized Text (em) :
The Emphasized Text is equal to the current font-size, for instance, if the font-size of the document is 12pt, 1em is equal to 
12pt. Ems are scalable in nature, so 2em would equal 24pt, . 5em would equal 6pt, etc.
