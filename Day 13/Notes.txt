There are certain elements that if we wrote them in normal HTML, they might collide with the syntax of HTML code.
Eg- like we wrote for <p></p>.

So we use - "&lt;" and "&gt;" for "<" and ">" respectively.

There is also another entity known as - "<pre>" tag
Through this, we can write our code as it is, whether with spaces, or with different empty lines; our lines of code will be 
shown as it is.
